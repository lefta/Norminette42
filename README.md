# 42 Norminette - Python version

This is the norminette of school 42, fully re-written in Python.


## Dependencies

* Python 3 (likely already installed on your system)
* Pika


## Usage

Just run norminette.py as you would run the official norminette.


## FAQ

### How is it working?

The checks are actually made on a server inside of the school, this script only sends your files to
this server and displays the results, like the official one. As such, there is no difference in the
displayed results, and will never be.


### Is it accurate? (May it be used in correction?)

Yes, this script will give the exact same result than the official norminette. See `how is it
working` for details.


### How do I know if it is up to date with the official one?

There may not be any version mismatch with the official one.  See `how is it working` for details.


## Known bugs / differences

* This script do not take norminette arguments like checkForbiddenHeaderSource. This will be fixed in a future version.
* This script does not work outside of the school network. This is not a restriction of this script, it is a restriction of the network infrastructure of 42.
